  "summary": "This Data Science roadmap provides a structured 8-12 month journey from mathematics fundamentals to production ML systems. Phase 1 builds mathematical foundations (linear algebra, statistics, calculus), Phase 2 develops programming expertise with Python and data tools, Phase 3 covers machine learning algorithms (supervised, unsupervised), Phase 4 explores advanced techniques (deep learning, NLP), and Phase 5 focuses on real-world projects and deployment. Through hands-on projects and competitions, you'll progress from understanding concepts to building end-to-end ML pipelines. By completion, you'll have the skills to analyze complex datasets, select appropriate algorithms, build production-grade models, and deploy solutions that create business value. The journey emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application, preparing you for junior data scientist roles and beyond."
